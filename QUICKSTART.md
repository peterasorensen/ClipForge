## üéØ Next Steps (For You)

Based on your message, you mentioned:
> "After we've stopped/finished, we should be redirected to a basic editor. Don't bother implementing it, we'll do that in the next step."

The app is now ready for you to add the video editor! When you're ready:
1. The recording saves as a WebM file
2. You can intercept the save flow to redirect to an editor
3. The editor can be a new window or replace the control bar

## üí° Tips

### Granting Permissions (macOS)
On first run, you may need to grant permissions:
1. **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Screen Recording**
2. Enable for Electron
3. Restart the app

### Development Mode
- DevTools open automatically for debugging
- Hot reload works for renderer changes
- Check console for any errors

### Testing Different Modes
- Use **Area** for custom regions
- Use **Window** to capture specific apps
- Use **Display** for full screen
- Toggle **Mic** before starting

## üêõ If Something Breaks

```bash
# Restart the app
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, then:
npm start

# Clear everything and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

## üì∏ What It Looks Like

**Control Bar**: Horizontal floating strip with icons and text labels, glassmorphism effect
**Selection Modes**: Full-screen overlays with purple accents and smooth interactions
**Recording Toolbar**: Compact bottom bar with timer and controls
